# Insertion Sequence Catalogue (ISC)

## About
This repository contains a catalogue of insertion sequences in FASTA format generated using [PaliDIS](https://github.com/blue-moon22/palidis).

It is currently recommended to only query this catalogue with genomes sourced from human oral and gut samples.
